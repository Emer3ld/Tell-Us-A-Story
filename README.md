# ðŸ’« About the project:
This project will use the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi to create an interactive device that recognises (specific) artefacts using image recognition technology and responds by playing an audio story about the object. Using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module for real-time image capture and TensorFlow Lite for efficient image processing, the system can classify images into predefined categories. If successful in recognition, the system plays back a short audio story, corresponding to the identified object, creating a pocket size immersive and educational experience.<br>

My inspiration comes from a popular 90's kids TV programmes such as Jackanory, books- Horrible Histories and the british museums app, where a factual account is given on 250 artefacts. I thought, how could I make looking at artefacts or a trip to the museum more engaging.

## Introduction
- an overview of what the project does
- your inspiration for making the project 
- examples that it is based on. 

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images are good!*

## Research Question
Can TinyML-optimised for image recognition model be deployed on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, coupled with an audio storytelling feature upon succesful image recognition,achieve real-time performance with high accuracy making it suitable for portable educational tools.


## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
